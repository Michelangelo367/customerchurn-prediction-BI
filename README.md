# Predicting customer churn of a Telecom Company (with BI recommendations)
A customer churn ML prediction with business intelligence recommendations

Here I walk through all the data analysis process: data exploration, wrangling, feature selection, algorithm training and testing, and analysis of the final model metrics. 

However, there are tons of ML classification algorithm for customer churn tutorials out there. What you'll find new in this repository is an in-depth analysis of the results to deliver business insights. Besides the technical data analysis, the data scientist should be able to answer the business questions. How the data analysis can benefit the business? How can the business manager improve the services in order to maintain her clients? Which should be her next steps? That's what I'm doing in this project: answering business questions based on data analysis.

I developed this project as part of my Data Science Training at the Data Science Academy. I still have to check if I can make the data available, that's why you won't find it here. Read the analysis in the **customerchurn-prediction-BI.ipynb** jupyter repository
